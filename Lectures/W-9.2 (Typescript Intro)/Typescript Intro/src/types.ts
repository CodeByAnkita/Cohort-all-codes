// similar to interface
// types can not use for implementing class

// Q. Diff. between types & interfaces
//  ans. interfaces is used to implement from the class while types is used to union or intersection if we don't know the datatype then using union (|) and  if we want from both types/interfaces then use intersection (&)

type User = {   // must be needed = sign
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    age: number;
}

// 1. Unions
// Letâ€™ say you want to print the id of a user, which can be a number or a string.

function printId(id: number | string) {     // we can use this for number or string
    console.log(id);
}

//  (or)
// using type
type StringOrNumber = number | string;

function printId1(id: StringOrNumber){
    console.log(id);
}

printId(5);
printId("5");


// 2. Intersection
// What if you want to create a type that has every property of multiple types/ interfaces

type Employee = {
    name: string;
    startDate: Date;
};

interface Manager {        // it can be both type / interface 
    name: string;
    department: string;
}

type TeamLead = Employee & Manager;     // all details from Employee and Manager . It must be of type

const tl: TeamLead = {
    name: 'Manas',
    startDate: new Date(),
    department: 'Fullstack'
}
